<div style="text-align: right"> <p>&quot;<em>The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull.<br>He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore, professore dottore Eco, what a library you have ! How many of these books have you read?” and the others - a very small minority - who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool.<br> Read books are far less valuable than unread ones.</em>&quot; <br> The black swan - N. N. Taleb</p>
