<p>&quot;<em>The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull.<br>He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore, professore dottore Eco, what a library you have ! How many of these books have you read?” and the others - a very small minority - who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool.<br> Read books are far less valuable than unread ones.</em>&quot; <br> The Black Swan - N.

### About me
  
---
  
I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the department of [Statistics of Univerisity of California - Irvine](https://www.stat.uci.edu/), working under the supervision of Professor [Babak Shahbaba](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~babaks/).  
I am interested in Bayesian statistics, Bayesian nonparametrics, model-based clustering, shrinkage priors, latent factor representation and more.
